Files Present
1. lsim_atpg
This is the logic simulator based atpg with controllability based partitioning and no reset signal masking. 
To compile this file: 
	g++ lsim_atpg.cpp
To run this file:
	./a.out -o iscas89/<circuit_name>

This will generate an output.vec file in the current directory which contains all the vectors generated by this program.
The number of generations and the number of times GA should run can only be altered from the main function at lines 656 and 666.

2. mod_fsim.cpp
This is the fault-simulator provided by Dr. Hsiao. It takes the output.vec file generated by lsim_atpg and tells us the number of faults that were detected.

To compile this file:
	g++ mod_fsim.cpp

To run this file:
	./a.out -d iscas89/<ckt_name>
For most circuits, lsim_atpg can take a very long time to generate vectors. For this reason, the output.vec files generated by lsim_atpg
for the most successful results we got for each circuit have been provided in the test_vectors directory.


To run the the fault simulator with these test vector files take the following steps:
1. Go to line 440 in mod_fsim.cpp
2. Change file name here from 'output.vec' to 'test_vectors/<vector_file_name>.vec'

	NOTE: Each vector file name has the format 'output_<ckt_name>_<number of generations>_<no. of times GA>_<rstmask/norstmask>.vec'
3. To compile this file:
 	g++ mod_fsim.cpp
4. To run this file:
	./a.out -d iscas89/<ckt_name> 	:Make sure this circuit name matches with the circuit name in the test vector file name format.
